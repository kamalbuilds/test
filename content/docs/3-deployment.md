## Integrations

In order to be able to deploy your app, you need to access the Preferences menu and select the Integrations tab. Log into your ZEIT account and it's all set.

## Deployment

Go to any of your sandboxes, click in the Deployment menu (the rocket icon in the sidebar) and click in "Deploy Sandbox". You'll need to sign in to [Now](https://zeit.co/now) when you're deploying for the first time. After you've signed in you will be able to click "Deploy Now". It will deploy the sandbox and give you a URL afterwards.

## Deployment Overview
